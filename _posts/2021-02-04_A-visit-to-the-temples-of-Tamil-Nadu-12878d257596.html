We used to visit nearby places like Madurai quite often. I could not visit Thanjavur during that time, however, the Chola temple there had been on my must-visit places for a long time so, we decided to do a trip in March of 2019 covering a few temple towns of Tamil Nadu.</p><figure name="afdb" id="afdb" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*BFt8pajBbt3s9zCSeCn_6Q.jpeg" data-width="4160" data-height="1970" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*BFt8pajBbt3s9zCSeCn_6Q.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Communicating with a taxi driver in Chennai. I don’t know Tamil but he knows broken English. Although a very funny situation, it is sometimes a bit irritating there.</figcaption></figure><p name="f2b2" id="f2b2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The plan was simple; I had to fly to Chennai and Lashitha would come from Bangalore, we’d stay there for some time and then set off to the smaller temple towns. We had planned to visit Mahabalipuram, Thanjavur, and/or Chidambaram if time permitted. I have been to Chennai a few times before and thus was not very interested in exploring the city, so after getting there on a humid afternoon, we took some time to rest as the day was very hot but in the evening went to the Marina beach for some cool breeze. We finished dinner and then returned back to our room.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="02c8" id="02c8" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*g4JXv0ziObAFEZs5eWKNPQ.jpeg" data-width="4160" data-height="3120" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*g4JXv0ziObAFEZs5eWKNPQ.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Welcomed by the bull statue in Mahabalipuram.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="3ea8" id="3ea8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The next day we planned to visit Mahabalipuram, southwards an hour away from there. It is an ancient place, fascinating many people with its beautiful rock crafted temples and other structures. It was very hot that day and we were literally tired of exploring the entire compound which is an open area. Mahabalipuram has some historical significance, and I think during the 2004 Tsunami, people spotted some underwater structures there. It could have been a trading port in the past. The structures present there seem to be pointing towards this aspect. Why would someone build so many structures randomly! The shore temple in Mahabalipuram is a masterpiece and unsurprisingly the focal point of the visit. One must spend some time there in order to appreciate the beauty and hard work devoted to this work. We saw the popular spots in Mahabalipuram. By evening we were tired and returned back to Chennai on a bus. Before leaving, we saw a person carving objects in marble. I sat down for some time there and was very impressed with his hard work. As a token of appreciation, we purchased a couple of small white marble elephants from him.</p><figure name="b75f" id="b75f" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*o7q8DYYEolxXMy7XmuiSvw.jpeg" data-width="3120" data-height="4160" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*o7q8DYYEolxXMy7XmuiSvw.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">A stone carved elephant in the same compound in Mahabalipuram.

The capital of the erstwhile Chola kingdom was calling us! We reached Thanjavur in the morning and had a scuffle with the hotel staff where we were supposed to stay. We left and booked another hotel nearby because of the rude behavior of the receptionist. Anyways, after taking some rest, we set out to explore the city. Thanjavur is a beautiful city, soaked in history with the Brihadishwarsa temple popularly known as the big Shiva temple locally, at one end being the trademark of the city. It is indeed an architectural marvel. Built by Rajaraja Chola around 1010 CE, it strikes awe when one sees it. The temple is very high, which must have been very difficult to build considering the technology of that age.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="3fc7" id="3fc7" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*0oru053gLi4d9jezEhdRIQ.jpeg" data-width="4160" data-height="3120" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*0oru053gLi4d9jezEhdRIQ.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">The Brihadeeshwara temple in the evening.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><figure name="9537" id="9537" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--figure"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*f9CjKjWmIMScXUtpd3FOiw.jpeg" data-width="3120" data-height="4160" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*f9CjKjWmIMScXUtpd3FOiw.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">The temple at night.</figcaption></figure><p name="56d8" id="56d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">After having lunch in a restaurant, we left for the museum in Thanjavur. Apart from the mighty Cholas, this town is also associated with the Marathas. There is an intact Maratha palace in the city. We visited that palace and were fascinated by its details. The museum of Thanjavur is right next to the palace. It has some really interesting collections. A giant whale skeleton attracts a lot of visitors. I liked the numerous Nataraja statues. Actually, the Nataraja temple in Chidambaram is also nearby and we missed visiting it on this trip. Maybe when I go to Rameshwaram next, it can be included in that visit.</p><figure name="17b5" id="17b5" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*m6p1oi0UIXewG1YCglhqEQ.jpeg" data-width="4160" data-height="3120" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*m6p1oi0UIXewG1YCglhqEQ.jpeg"></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="7fce" id="7fce" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--figure"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*zIrBVQJCxbB6gZd-HzxBPA.jpeg" data-width="4160" data-height="3120" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*zIrBVQJCxbB6gZd-HzxBPA.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">At the Maratha palace in Tanjavur</figcaption></figure><figure name="e414" id="e414" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--figure"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*p7fZgjehazP2l4rgGBmBgQ.jpeg" data-width="4160" data-height="3120" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*p7fZgjehazP2l4rgGBmBgQ.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">A bust of maratha ruler <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serfoji_II" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serfoji_II" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Serfoji II Bhonsle </a>in the palace compound.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="838e" id="838e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">From the museum, we walked to the Brihadeeshwara temple, which is approximately 1.5 Kilometers away. The streets of Thanjavur seemed a bit different, with most of the stores having people indulged in art and craft rather than the streets being lined up with general stores. Of course, Thanjavur paintings are famous all around the world. I did not know that the puppets from here were also very famous. There were plenty of shops selling paintings and other crafts.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="9488" id="9488" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*iV49tYNalaJJ4iY5v9jQAA.jpeg" data-width="4160" data-height="3120" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*iV49tYNalaJJ4iY5v9jQAA.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Thanjavur painting for sale!!</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="0584" id="0584" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">So we reached the temple in the evening. The sight of the temple is majestic. It is a huge temple indeed. The chief deity of the temple is Lord Shiva. The Shiv Linga situated inside is around 30 feet tall, easily the largest Shiv Linga I have ever seen in my life. The temple is very well managed. The compound is huge and the remarkable thing I have found about this temple is the open spaces. Often, the Hindu temples are located in locations packed with buildings, with narrow alleys leading to the sanctum sanctorum, Here, there is a huge open area, kind of a courtyard, and huge lawns around the temple. Even if many people visit the temple at a time, it doesn’t feel very crowded. One can sit in the open spaces around the temple for as long as one may want.</p><p name="529b" id="529b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We stayed in the temple well past the sunset as I find sitting in the temple compound to be a very peaceful exercise. In between, we circled the temple at least twice, looking at the sculptures and admiring the beauty of this masterpiece of architecture. I wonder why it is not on the list of the wonders of the world.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="6e2c" id="6e2c" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*5NHKisLyIq1vO8O_jerRfA.jpeg" data-width="4160" data-height="3120" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*5NHKisLyIq1vO8O_jerRfA.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">The temple is an inspiration for graffiti everywhere in Tanjavur. This is near the Tanjavur railway station.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="1a91" id="1a91" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The next day, we planned to have an outstation trip from Thanjavur. We were thinking of either Chidambaram or Kumbakonam. Chidambaram is around 130 km away from Thanjavur and it would have been difficult to return the same day as we were using public buses only. So we decided to go to Kumbakonam, a city in between. Kumbakonam is famous for being a place with a temple in every corner. Kumbakonam is lined up with temples. Everywhere you see, there are only gopurams and gopurams. What a beautiful sight indeed! Unfortunately, we reached there in the afternoon which turned out to be ‘lunchtime’ for even Gods, and most of the temples were temporarily closed. We managed to enter one temple and sat there for some time. We had lunch, and then returned to Thanjavur by train saving us half the time. Although not visiting Chidambaram was a regret it was compensated very well in the evening.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="73f9" id="73f9" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*5K-WlrQ-ZKUIL38ctmqc9g.jpeg" data-width="4160" data-height="3120" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*5K-WlrQ-ZKUIL38ctmqc9g.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">The entrance or ‘gopuram’ for the big temple.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><figure name="2ec2" id="2ec2" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--figure"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Elv7SuH2MpDrm5wxfxKvMg.jpeg" data-width="4160" data-height="3120" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Elv7SuH2MpDrm5wxfxKvMg.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Women busy with some rituals in the temple compound. The open courtyard of the temple attracted me the most.</figcaption></figure><p name="8f58" id="8f58" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">We again went to the Chola temple in the evening. From there, we had planned to go directly to the bus station to catch our bus back to Chennai. We were extremely lucky to be present there on an auspicious occasion. “Nataynjali”, a dance festival in the temple compound itself supported by the Ministry of culture, Govt. of India was taking place at that very time. It was bliss indeed. Professional dancers, as well as little students from all over Southern India, were present there to perform. We saw a lot of Bharatnatyam performances on stage. It was a very exciting experience indeed. We went without an invitation to an art festival!!</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="9e6c" id="9e6c" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*ShCOXNNnetrlWSjmE1A_kQ.jpeg" data-width="4160" data-height="3120" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*ShCOXNNnetrlWSjmE1A_kQ.jpeg"></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><figure name="f3cf" id="f3cf" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--figure"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*i3TTB5SUiz7Z9LNnBRKe0Q.jpeg" data-width="4160" data-height="3120" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*i3TTB5SUiz7Z9LNnBRKe0Q.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Dance performance in front of the temple.</figcaption></figure><p name="e552" id="e552" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">A couple of Bharatnatyam videos I shot during the festival: <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/JpJGkq3XbGnkTGWr5" data-href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/JpJGkq3XbGnkTGWr5" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Video</a>1 and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/kvnNANNuQ1PThwK4A" data-href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/kvnNANNuQ1PThwK4A" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Video2</a>.</p><p name="87d8" id="87d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After leaving the place, we immediately proceeded for dinner. We had a usual south Indian dinner with some dosa and finished with some coffee. People in Thanjavur are used to a lot of tourists visiting. This was apparent in the treatment we got in the various restaurants and public transport services there. I have lived in Tamil Nadu and interacted with a lot of people there, partly because of my habit of talking a lot and partly because of my affection for the culture of Southern India. I have never felt any sense of alienation in Tamil Nadu, contrary to what people believe in the Northern side of the country.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="3044" id="3044" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*5YL5cBC5hypfux_Xw1N_VA.jpeg" data-width="4160" data-height="1970" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*5YL5cBC5hypfux_Xw1N_VA.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">This might look like someone’s home, but is a beautiful restaurant right across the road from the Shiva temple.

We had booked the YBM travels sleeper for return. They have a good fleet of Scania and Mercedes sleeper buses and prices are quite affordable. Without any problems, we were in Chennai the next morning. A few of my friends are working towards their Ph.D. there in Chennai, so we thought of visiting them. We met them, had our breakfast, and then left for the city. As my flight was scheduled in the evening, we planned to visit a museum and then leave. The Integral Coach Factory (ICF) which makes the coaches for the Indian railways has a nice museum near Perambur, but I think it was closed that day. So, we went to the state museum in Chennai. It is located near Egmore. Being a state museum, it is not in a very good condition especially if we compare it to the shiny National Museum in Delhi, which I visited a lot during my childhood. ANyways, the museum was worth visiting. It is the second oldest museum in India. After spending a couple of hours there, we went to a nearby restaurant for lunch. After lunch, I took a local train to Meenambakkam, which is within a walking distance from the airport. I love this thing about Chennai. The metro station, the railway station, and the bus stand are within walking distance from the airport. No need to spend hugely on taxi services or Volvo buses! (Remember Kempegowda airport!). Anyways, my flight left at the scheduled time and I reached Delhi by late evening. From there, I had booked another bus to Nainital. By the next morning, I was in my room rejoicing the memories of the temples of Tamil Nadu!!!</p></div></div></section>
