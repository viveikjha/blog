With no end in sight, and the future hanging in balance, I don’t think this is the best time to concentrate on academic research. Yet, being in the middle of a Ph.D. degree with time running out, I have to focus on my research at any cost!</p><p name="e838" id="e838" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">​How sanity can be maintained?</p><p name="9040" id="9040" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Is it even possible?<br> ​<br> During June and July, things eased further, with markets opening more, and gradually people returned, yet nothing like the pre-covid era. We are in the last week of July now, and they have still locked up the iconic Delhi Metro for another month. The public buses are running with a strict limit of 20 individuals, and huge crowds on the bus stands have become a part of life for office goers on weekdays. My father, who works in the central government services, has also started going to the office twice a week, but of course, public transport is off-limits. The markets are open, and almost every product is readily available. Taking a stroll through the market, I easily sense that the fear of catching coronavirus is long gone from the public. Yet people are wearing masks, queuing up with a distance and some shopkeepers offer sanitizers to every customer.</p><p name="aa85" id="aa85" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">During the initial days of March and April, when even a single case raised a lot of eyebrows, compared to that people have relaxed a lot. This may be because of the low death rate and a better situation in New Delhi, but I feel things need to open up more now, as this COVID-19 situation may persist for years.</p><p name="69b9" id="69b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We can’t return to the institute even now, despite both sides willing for us to be there. The local government there has put strict restrictions on people coming from high covid cases like New Delhi, making it impossible for me to return. Hopefully, things clear up a bit in the next few weeks and we return to the regular work life.</p><p name="7c58" id="7c58" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Well, my experience of this entire crisis has been that I have gained a lot of mental strength during this time. It is not very easy to retreat from the unending plethora of news, all about the disease and a looming economic crisis coming at us. But it is necessary to be strong in these tough times. A realistic view of the crisis will be to live in the present and think in terms of days and weeks and not months and years. There are plenty of small and big problems and similarly, there are small and big moments of joy in our everyday life that we need to cherish.</p><p name="140f" id="140f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, a code not performing as desired is not a very good way to start the day, but hey, we are being trained to handle exactly that professionally. We are not expected to cry over these things!</p><p name="0f60" id="0f60" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Research is challenging, and the people involved in that know it exactly. I learn that too. During a Ph.D., a very common procedure to solve issues is to immediately barge into the cabin of your senior fellows, if it’s not worthy enough for your supervisor. Stuck at home. How can we even think of doing that!!<br> ​<br> Especially with parents around in the home, having no clue of the troubles we are going through, it becomes a really difficult task and demotivating. Of course, we have all the communication channels open in some form, thanks to the internet, and I use them often. The jokes we used to laugh at during the lunch and tea breaks, the brief discussions we used to have before and after seminars, the long nights when we used to chat in the room brewing endless cups of tea are all gone. Back in the pre-covid era, there was not a single weekend when we did not visit the city to have spicy fish and mutton curry! People say the man is a social animal, never in my life, I realized the importance of this statement. The entire social network, so to speak, collapsed in front of our eyes.</p><p name="7360" id="7360" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Coming to the academic activities, I have been fortunate enough in the sense that my work has progressed at a steady pace in the past few months. I have obtained the requested telescope time, even during the global coronavirus lockdown, and have been observing a few objects for my scientific projects. A few of my seniors are in constant touch with me, and barring a few episodes of negative thoughts seeping into my head, I have little to complain about my work. Of course, the measure of the amount of progress is something that I am not capable of right now, but I can say confidently that my projects have been moving steadily.</p><p name="56fb" id="56fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have kept myself busy in a variety of ways. During the ‘hard lockdown’ stage, which lasted until the last week of May, there was nothing much to do outside the home! Even walking out for a kilometer seemed like hard work with the armed police forces stationed at almost every corner in my neighborhood. It used to be a containment zone then. I have a library of books to spend my time on and finished around 10 books in my leisure time.</p><p name="af2f" id="af2f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Things eased in the last week of May, we could shop online, and the ‘non-essential’ labeled shops could open. I could finally travel within Delhi, and the scenes I saw were unbelievable. The bus stops looked like they have not been used for ages. The university campus looked like a ghost town, which I could not even imagine! The public spots like the Red Fort or the India Gate, or the most popular market: the Connaught place wore an eerily deserted look. Few people were out on the roads.</p><blockquote name="b371" id="b371" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Google photos album (Coronavirus lockdown 2020):</em></blockquote><blockquote name="ec4d" id="ec4d" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/AwdpoRWtf8kZNzNi9" data-href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/AwdpoRWtf8kZNzNi9" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://photos.app.goo.gl/AwdpoRWtf8kZNzNi9</a></blockquote><p name="127b" id="127b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote graf--trailing">Update:<br>Finally, after undergoing a COVID-19 RT-PCR test in Delhi, and armed with a negative result, I returned to my institute in Nainital on the 7th of September, effectively ending 6 months of the homestay.</p></div></div></section>
