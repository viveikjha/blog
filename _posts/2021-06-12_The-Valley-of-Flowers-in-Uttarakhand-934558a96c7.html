Situated at the altitude of 3500+ m and beyond, this meadow attracts a lot of people both from India and around the world. My plans to visit this place materialized only in June 2019, when I was working in Nainital and managed to get a week off. This article recounts my experience in that serene environment.</p><p name="fe67" id="fe67" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From Nainital, we took an overnight sleeper train to Haridwar. Why Haridwar? It turns out that the pilgrims from all over India visit the<a href="https://badrinath-kedarnath.gov.in/" data-href="https://badrinath-kedarnath.gov.in/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Char Dham temples </a>namely: The Gangotri (the temple dedicated to River Ganga), The Yamunotri (the temple dedicated to river Yamuna), The Kedarnath (temple dedicated to Lord Shiva), and The Badrinath (temple dedicated to a form of Lord Vishnu) during these months. This is a huge opportunity for the travel operators in Uttarakhand, and from Haridwar (translating as <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">the door to God</em>), buses are quite easily available to all these 4 places. The <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Valley of Flowers</strong> is located in Chamoli district, near the Badrinath temple, hence we hopped onto a bus to Badrinath from Haridwar. It was a 12-hour journey on the bus, a tiring journey indeed. The road to all the temples is being re-constructed as an all-weather 4-lane highway and it turned out, it was in a pathetic condition during that time.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="6932" id="6932" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*z05Bfuabyq5WV2cxCceVuw.jpeg" data-width="4160" data-height="1970" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*z05Bfuabyq5WV2cxCceVuw.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">The river Ganga in Haridwar in the early morning.

The<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> dhabas </em>where we stopped, were nothing more than basic places where one can have food and tea, buy water and snacks. But we can’t expect more than this from these places in these remote locations.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="2a3d" id="2a3d" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*32H7oQ_fzH0DNehlabrFDA.jpeg" data-width="4160" data-height="1970" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*32H7oQ_fzH0DNehlabrFDA.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">At a roadside “Dhaba” on or way from Haridwar to Badrinath.

It is a temple town, farther from any other town in India, and located right near the border with China. 3 Km from Badrinath is Mana village, which is the last village on the Indian side. Yet, the liveliness of the place is fascinating indeed. There are numerous hotels ranging from the very cheap ones to the ones with some luxury, catering to different types of people visiting the place. We did not book any accommodation prior to arriving there, and booking a room is pretty easy there as plenty of options are available. The sadhus ( holy men) are present everywhere and as one approaches the temple, their numbers increase as is the case with temples all over India. Besides this, the atmosphere in Badrinath is divine and despite the ensuing chaos all around, one can find peace there. Overall, it is a typical temple town in India, only located at a remote location. We visited the temple in the evening, and after having dinner returned back to our room in the hotel for rest.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="5ceb" id="5ceb" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*bBppOo_v8Ynt91se9_4ODw.jpeg" data-width="4160" data-height="3120" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*bBppOo_v8Ynt91se9_4ODw.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">In Badrinath.

From Govindghat, in order to reach the Valley of Flowers, one has to trek for approximately 14km. Actually, this place has a very famous gurudwara: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurudwara_Shri_Hemkund_Sahib" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurudwara_Shri_Hemkund_Sahib" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Hemkunt Sahib</a>, located at an altitude of 4600m which is of religious importance to the Sikh pilgrims. There is a Gurudwara in Govindghat as well, and one can find a lot of Sikh people both in Govind ghat and Ghangharia. There is a helicopter service from Govindghat to Ghangharia and plenty of mules are available for people who are not willing/unable to walk.</p><p name="67c1" id="67c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We left Badrinath in the early morning and reached Govindghat within an hour. From there, we started our trek to Ghangharia. We both had ample trekking experience, and this walk of 14km was not difficult for our bodies, although we took a lot of rest in order to enjoy the scenery that we were witnessing. We reached Ghangharia in the evening.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="7db8" id="7db8" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*qo8_ut_pDw8_JVJqbW7h5A.jpeg" data-width="4160" data-height="1970" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*qo8_ut_pDw8_JVJqbW7h5A.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Plenty of Snow on our way towards the Valley of flowers.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="0183" id="0183" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Ghangharia is a settlement intended to cater to the pilgrims to Hemkunt Sahib gurudwara and people visiting the Valley of flowers. It has a gurudwara too, which takes care of the people arriving there, by providing food, shelter, and blankets. The weather is pretty cold, and it is advisable to carry thick jackets there. Anyway, after reaching Ghangharia, we went around for a walk and finished dinner. The room we booked there was a basic one, understandably so and we immediately went to our beds to prepare ourselves for the exciting trek the next day.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="2202" id="2202" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*5jqSj1n5uWdgacLz46MhPA.jpeg" data-width="4160" data-height="3120" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*5jqSj1n5uWdgacLz46MhPA.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">A freshwater stream which we needed to cross during the trek from Govindghat to Ghangharia.

The right one leads to the Hemkunt Sahib Gurudwara and the left one leads to the Nanda Devi Valley of flowers. There is a manned checkpoint there, where one has to get the entry permits. It cost Rs. 120 per person and the forest officials there were kind enough to explain to us the map of the Valley of flowers. There were clear instructions on where to visit, and from where we had to return back. The plastic items are forbidden and we were instructed not to litter the place. They wished us good luck and we started on our journey of exploring the heavenly place!</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="f01e" id="f01e" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*XDITyLHDWoEmhVz2YEbJiA.jpeg" data-width="4160" data-height="3120" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*XDITyLHDWoEmhVz2YEbJiA.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Entering the valley of flowers.

We moved on further, enjoying the views that were serene and seemed heavenly.</p><p name="5d1f" id="5d1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The valley of flowers is a well-maintained national park, and not many people could be seen when we were there. In fact, the forest official at the gate told us that a girl went alone a few minutes ahead of us, and we should take her along when we find her. We found her within a few minutes, and she started the trek along with us, although at a slower pace. The path is marked out pretty well, with stone trails and occasional little bridges.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="d180" id="d180" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*gkpKxgmAK8yuzZiZb9yuKA.jpeg" data-width="4160" data-height="3120" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*gkpKxgmAK8yuzZiZb9yuKA.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">A little glacier immediately after we entered the valley of flowers.

The grip of the shoes was tested and we managed to cross these paths without a fall, in the initial stages. We stopped in between quite often in order to enjoy the scenery and soak ourselves in the purity of nature. The silence of the place seemed blissful and we did not want to leave the place at all! It felt so homely at that moment.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetRow" data-paragraph-count="2"><figure name="ebd3" id="ebd3" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRow is-partialWidth graf-after--p" style="width: 50%;"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*5lsD5daVyNe2TU_Grzc9wQ.jpeg" data-width="3120" data-height="4160" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*5lsD5daVyNe2TU_Grzc9wQ.jpeg"></figure><figure name="04c8" id="04c8" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRowContinue is-partialWidth graf-after--figure" style="width: 50%;"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*hhZAr_WBG6J2pqBzXIL-eg.jpeg" data-width="3120" data-height="4160" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*hhZAr_WBG6J2pqBzXIL-eg.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption" style="width: 200%; left: -100%;">A path through the snow that we had to cross.

This was the Valley of flowers we wanted to visit for so long. The first sight of the valley left us speechless. We did not even look at each other, and the view of the pristine meadow ahead of us awakened the child inside of me. I wanted to throw my jacket and run around that place just like the children. It felt so free, relaxing, and joyful at the same time. Sometimes, I feel these are the moments due to which we travel to far-off places. Anyway, after sitting there for a few minutes, we started our walk in the valley. The flowers specific to this place only had started appearing once we entered the valley.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="af24" id="af24" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*QOmZj0A-ZId_gqfS5ww__g.jpeg" data-width="4160" data-height="3120" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*QOmZj0A-ZId_gqfS5ww__g.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">The glimpse of the Valley of flowers.

It was easily the most beautiful place I have been to in my life so far. It was cloudy since morning, and at that very moment, light drizzle started. We did not have any shelter in that valley but we were carrying raincoats. So, we immediately put our rain covers on and started walking further.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="b9a7" id="b9a7" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*-mGfLno1oQ2SBHuUk5mxCA.jpeg" data-width="4160" data-height="1970" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*-mGfLno1oQ2SBHuUk5mxCA.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Entering the Valey of flowers.</figcaption></figure><figure name="3f7d" id="3f7d" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--figure"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*avaAy_sU0xJp32y146C2bQ.jpeg" data-width="4160" data-height="3120" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*avaAy_sU0xJp32y146C2bQ.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">The trail in the Valley is well laid out making the place quite easy to explore.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="a94b" id="a94b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">While walking we found a group of people who were traveling from Nainital as well. We had a lot of interactions with them, and we started moving together. One of them was vlogging the entire experience, and we were cracking jokes with each other and shared lunch when the rain stopped. The entire valley is stretched over a few kilometers and usually, people explore the valley according to their speed of walking. The point is that we have to return back to the check post by evening, as it’s illegal to stay in the valley at night.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="1e13" id="1e13" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*gEgyNrjlklDODKNhvFam_Q.jpeg" data-width="4160" data-height="3120" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*gEgyNrjlklDODKNhvFam_Q.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">One of our resting points in the Valley.

Initially, we decided not to cross it but since we had plenty of time in hand, we planned to cross it. Crossing a glacier with an unpaved path is not something we should do especially at these altitudes where a small mistake may result in death, but the adrenaline overtook us and we started crossing it. It was steep in some places, and almost all of us slipped at some point. We managed to cross the glacier by holding hands and walking very slowly. Once we crossed the glacier, the valley was even more beautiful. There was a curve with total snow, and we planned to slide on it, but looking at the boulders in between decided against it.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="f517" id="f517" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*KQ5bKSr7oq9hQsXGuIXlSg.jpeg" data-width="4160" data-height="3120" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*KQ5bKSr7oq9hQsXGuIXlSg.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">A glacier we wanted to cross but did not have well laid out path.

So, after drinking fresh stream water we started our trek back. Of course, I did not want to leave this place at all. Even today, when I remember that day, I want to travel there immediately. While returning, we had to cross the same glacier. This time, we decided to go around it and cross the stream below instead of crossing that glacier. It would take time, but at least it was a safer option. The other guys still took the risk of crossing the glacier and the girl (the one whom we took along earlier in the day) went with them. She had a slip and almost fell from there. One of the guys held her hand and she was ‘saved’. Had he not held her hand, she’d have fallen at least 200m into the valley risking her life. We were watching this from the stream below, and we were indeed scared for her. Thankfully, she managed to get hold of herself and crossed the glacier with them successfully. But, she was scared indeed and was having difficulty while returning back to the check post. Anyway, since we were in a group, everyone took her along and without a problem, we could reach the check post.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="34f7" id="34f7" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*JOm7YlDjullNCGAbripJmQ.jpeg" data-width="4898" data-height="3265" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*JOm7YlDjullNCGAbripJmQ.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Along with the people we met in the Valley itself.

So, we decided to travel to Joshimath and try our luck there, So, we boarded a taxi to Joshimath and went to the taxi stand there. From there, we could find a taxi to Rishikesh only. It was not a good experience in that shared taxi, with the broken roads and too much heat and dust in between. Just a couple of days, ago we were in the lap of nature appreciating its beauty, and here we were biting the dust for the entire day!</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="2ce2" id="2ce2" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*CkeXIPp8Pm_soxHsVA_VuA.jpeg" data-width="4160" data-height="3120" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*CkeXIPp8Pm_soxHsVA_VuA.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">The dusty road on our return journey.

I have spent my childhood in these regions, so the places are quite known to me. In Dehradun, we immediately went to the INter state bus terminus (ISBT) in order to catch a bus to Nainital. Plenty of buses are available connecting the two cities, so we did not have a problem finding an overnight bus to Nainital. We reached Nainital the next morning. It was raining again! We went to our rooms, rejoining the memories we had that day we sept in the valley of flowers. It was a memorable journey indeed and we’d definitely want to visit the place again.</p><h3 name="d0da" id="d0da" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Important points to be noted for this trip:</h3><blockquote name="8957" id="8957" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--h3">Trek: Govindghat to Ghangharia (14km).Helicopter is available from Godindghat to Ghangharia at reasonalbe prices.
